# Distributed and Event Based Systems (DEBS) conference website
- Website is built using the typical Jekyll SSG available in GitHub Pages (using GitHub Actions as defined within `.github`).
- `docker-compose.yml` is provided so that local building should be possible using `docker compose up` (note that the Jekyll website is exposed on host port 4001 rather than 4000).
- A `devcontainer.json` is provided for editing environments with appropriate support.
